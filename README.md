# Time-series-forecasting
Time series forecasting project 
In this project, we were asked to predict future samples of uncorrelated time series given in input with a fixed length  of 200. The goal was to implement a forecasting model that leverages past observations in the input series to predict  future values. The task requires the model to exhibit generalization capabilities in the forecasting domain, i.e. it is required  a model that is not limited in predicting in a single or predefined time domain.
